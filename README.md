# Movement-Decomposition
A set of tools for analyzing human movement using decomposition methods such as SVD, PCA and ICA

**SVD**
The SVD.py script located in the DecompositionExamples will produce reduced representations of .c3d format motion capture recordings using Singular Value Decomposition. By specifying the desired rank of the output, you can vary how many components are used to reconstruct the movement. Lower rank representations show only the most basic aspects of movement.
